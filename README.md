## Welcome to the Archipelago

This repository houses a growing collection of spatial data projects, each exploring different corners of our mapped world. Each "island" in this archipelago represents a self-contained R project with its own data pipeline, analysis, and visual outputs.

Whether you're a fellow spatial analyst, data visualization enthusiast, or simply curious about the stories maps can tell, you'll find reproducible R code and compelling visualizations across diverse geographic themes.

## Navigation Guide

### For Data Enthusiasts
- **Browse by topic**: Use the tags above to find projects in your area of interest
- **Start with featured**: Check out [Project name](projects/project-001-project-name/) for a comprehensive example of the analysis pipeline

### For R Developers
- **Shared resources**: Common functions and themes are in [`_shared/`](_shared/)
- **Project templates**: Use the standardized structure in [`_shared/templates/`](_shared/templates/) for consistency
- **Dependencies**: Each project includes its own `renv.lock` for reproducible environments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```r
# Core spatial packages used across projects
install.packages(c("sf", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "leaflet", "tmap"))
```

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rchipelago.git`
2. Navigate to any project folder
3. Open the project's README for specific setup instructions
4. Run scripts in numerical order (01_, 02_, 03_...)

## Repository Structure

```
Rchipelago/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _shared/          # Common functions, themes, and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/         # Individual analysis projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/             # GitHub Pages site (coming soon)

```

Each project follows a consistent structure:
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets
- `scripts/` - Numbered R scripts for the analysis pipeline  
- `outputs/` - Generated maps, plots, and reports
- `README.md` - Project-specific documentation
